# Advanced Complete Ubuntu Forensic Script

This script is designed to perform an advanced forensic analysis on an Ubuntu laptop. It automatically collects a wide range of system information, conducts some basic checks, and provides guidance for further in-depth investigation.

**Description**

This script aims to gather comprehensive data that can be helpful in identifying potential security breaches, malware infections, or unauthorized activities on an Ubuntu system. It automates the collection of logs, process lists, network configurations, and performs basic scans for rootkits and suspicious activities. Please note that while this script automates many data gathering tasks, a thorough forensic analysis often requires manual investigation and expert knowledge.

**Usage**

1.  **Save the script:** Save the script to a file named `advanced_complete_forensic.sh` using a text editor like `nano`:
    ```bash
    nano advanced_complete_forensic.sh
    ```
2.  **Make it executable:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the script. Then, give the script execute permissions:
    ```bash
    chmod +x advanced_complete_forensic.sh
    ```
3.  **Run the script:** Execute the script with `sudo` privileges as it requires root access for many of its operations:
    ```bash
    sudo ./advanced_complete_forensic.sh
    ```
    You will be prompted for your sudo password.

4.  **Review the output:** After the script has finished running, the detailed output will be saved in the file `forensic_report.txt` within the `/tmp/advanced_complete_forensic_backup` directory. Carefully examine this file for any signs of suspicious activity or misconfigurations.

**Important Notes**

* This script is intended to assist in the initial stages of forensic analysis by automating data collection. It should not be considered a definitive or complete solution for all security incidents.
* For a comprehensive and accurate forensic investigation, especially in cases of suspected advanced attacks, it is highly recommended to consult with a professional cybersecurity expert.
* The output file (`forensic_report.txt`) contains a wealth of information about your system. Review it thoroughly and investigate any entries that appear unusual or unexpected.
